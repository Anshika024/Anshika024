<h1 align="center> Women-Unified</h1>
 Women Unified is a long term initiative to chart out sustainable solutions to women's cause. The project aims at bringing about a practical solution to the issues of harassment, exploitation and crimes against women in multiple domains.
The vision is to bring forth a change in the minds of people starting from an individual leveland empower women to fight against gender-based violence or abuse. We intend to combine different fields of knowledge and workforce (literature, peace, environment, religion, science, social science, and technology) towards peaceful living.
